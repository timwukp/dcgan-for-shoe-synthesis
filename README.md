How to use GAN to create new fashion Synthesis Shoe to assist designer
There has a new approach to assist their fashion designer for next seasonal new style design. The new design should refer industry hot seasonal style, and create new fashion style, which can assist and inspire their designer in new idea. GAN can generate new fashion Synthesis design, it can run on AWS Sagemaker notebook instance (ml.p3.2xlarge) for demonstration.

GAN is a framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which it simultaneously trains two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively. The dataset is UT Zappos50K (UT-Zap50K), which is a large shoe dataset consisting of 50,025 catalog images collected from Zappos.com. The images are divided into 4 major categories — shoes, sandals, slippers, and boots — followed by functional types and individual brands. The shoes are centered on a white background and pictured in the same orientation for convenient analysis. I use 12875 sports shoes as dataset to generate new style sport shoes.
